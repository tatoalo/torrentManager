torrentManager can be used to automatically perform operations like: 
* stop seeding process once download of a specific tag or category has completed
* remove torrents (metadata & files) of a specific tag or category group

The core has been developed in a quick and easy manner, on purpose to be easily extendible, using the very well documented qBittorrent API.

I am using a simple polling strategy and a local persistent key-value storage mechanism, both of this choices can be easily tweaked or swapped with different components and choices really easily.

### Docker

The container expects to load the [configuration file](#configuration) from `/config/configuration.toml` so mount a volume accordingly.

```
$ docker run -itd \
             --rm \
             -v /path/to/my/configuration/file:/config/file \
             tatoalo/torrent-manager
```

#### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  torrentmanager:
    image: tatoalo/torrent-manager
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /path/to/my/configuration/file:/config/file
```

### Configuration

The configuration file allows the authentication mechanism towards the qBittorrent instance, download/upload limits, interested categories and their respective save paths.

```toml
[qbt]
host = "host"
port = 6942
username = "username"
password = "password"

# B/s
[qbt_config]
dl_limit = -1
up_limit = -1

[qbt_categories]
categories = ["cat", "cat2"]

[targets]
dir_targets = { "cat" = "path", "cat2" = "path" }
```

### Custom Scheduling

The default scheduling mechanism is stored in `torrent-manager-cron`, although a custom schedule can be introduced in one of two ways:

- Edit `torrent-manager-cron` accordingly and rebuild the image
- Edit the environment variables directly in the `docker run` command or `docker compose` file, namely.
It is possible to just customize a single mechanism (`launcher` or `cleaner`) or even both in the same context, these are the env variables:
  - `LAUNCHER_CRON` for when the main launcher is executed
  - `CLEANER_CRON` for when the cleaning mechanism is executed
